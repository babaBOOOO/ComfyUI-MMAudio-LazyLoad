The exact same repo as Kijai's, but this version loads the MMAudio models on-demand when they are actually needed in a multi-step workflow execution scheme. 

Created with Opencode Big Pickle because I can't code lol. Works as per my testing, nothing else about the nodes was changed other than model loading behavior.
